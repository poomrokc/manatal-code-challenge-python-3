# Exercise 3: Algorithmic Test

by Poompatai Puntitpong

## Task description

Write a Python program to convert an integer to a roman numeral. Roman digits are: digits = ["M", "CM", "D", "CD”, "C", "XC", "L", "XL”, "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I"]

## Python and external modules used

    -Python 3.7.4
    -Pytest 5.3.4
    
## Remarks

For numbers greater than 3000 I decided that the output would just be lots of M. For example 5001 would become MMMMMI. But if you wish to insert more symbols for the digits, feel free to update symbols and max_digit variables at the top of the program.
